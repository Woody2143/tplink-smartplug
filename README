This project is a fork of "TP-Link WiFi SmartPlug Client and
Wireshark Dissector" by Lubomir Stroetmann [1]. softScheck Gmbh has a
nice article ("Reverse Engineering the TP-Link HS110") describing the
work behind the original project [2]. To get the most from this or
the original project, I strongly recommend reading that article.
Others have also written code based on the original project [3] or on
their own work [4]. 

The primary purpose of this fork is to convert the code from Python
to Perl. I am intentionally removing the Python file, the Lua Lua
file (and its related PNG file), and the tddp-client directory as I
will not be modifying or maintaining them at this time.

This is an adaption rather than a literal translation from Python to
Perl. I have also divided this into a module and a sample client.
